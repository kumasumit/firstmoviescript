hi my name is sumit, 
i was going to a walk once.
i saw  something i could barely recognize, i was astonished and perturbed at the same time.
I tried  going near the unindentified object, suddenly it become clear it was a ai powered robomachine, trying to communicate with me.
I was intrigued. 
It was mostly human like, it could replicate nearly all human emotions with high degree of accuracy.
It was exciting as it felt like I was talking to another human being, it was very life like.
